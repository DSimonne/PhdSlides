        Pressure gap:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Typical industrial pressures between 1-12 bar and temperatures ranging from 1073-1223 K
            \item Most of the studies are performed at low pressures ($< 10^{-2} mbar$)
            \item Near-ambient pressure experiment
        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{2cm}
        Material gap:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Platinum–rhodium wires, diameters in the range of 60–80 $\mu m$
            \item Pt nanoparticles and single crystals
        \end{itemize}

% Nowadays, stacks of up to 50 knitted gauzes composed of platinum–rhodium wires with rhodium contents of 5–10 wt.% and wire diameters in the range of 60–80 μm have replaced the long term industry standard of woven platinum gauzes [2–4].

% In operation the catalyst gauzes undergo onsiderable reconstruction starting with smooth wires and ending with corroded wires covered with fractal structures in the shape of cauliflowers
